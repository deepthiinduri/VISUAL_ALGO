## Features

- **Data Structure Visualization**: Visual Algo allows students to interact with visualizations of common data structures such as arrays, queues, stacks, trees, and graphs. Users can see how elements are inserted into and deleted from these data structures.

- **Tree Traversal**: Users can explore different tree traversal methods, including preorder, in-order, post-order, and level-order. The tool provides a visual representation of how these traversals work.

- **Algorithm Animation**: Visual Algo provides a simple language that allows students to write their own algorithms and see their execution animated. This feature enhances understanding of algorithmic concepts and processes.

- **Sorting Algorithms**: The tool includes sorting methods like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, random sort, count sort, radix sort, and more.

- **Linked Lists**: Users can interact with linked lists, a fundamental data structure, and understand their operations.

- **Binary Search Trees**: Visual Algo covers binary search trees and their operations, aiding students in grasping this critical data structure.

- **Bit Manipulation**: The tool explores bit manipulation techniques, which are essential in various computer science applications.

- **Code Editor**: Visual Algo also includes an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editor, allowing users to practice web programming and create sample web pages.
